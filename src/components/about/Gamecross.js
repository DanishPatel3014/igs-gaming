<h2>Games That People<br/>Will Play For Years</h2>
<p>Our ambition was to build game services with such a lengthy lifespan. And we wanted to make them accessible to as many individuals as possible. They'd be games that practically everyone could participate in. We sought to construct this longevity around two main pillars: gameplay and social interaction. We were convinced of the potential of basic, enjoyable gameplay. Many of us yearned for the good old days of PC gaming when it was all about having fun. When it comes to social, we simply believe that games are more enjoyable when played with friends and other people.</p>

<h2>Cross-platform Beginnings</h2>
<p>The notion of creating cross-platform gaming services — games that you could log into and play from any device – was a big element of our original product vision back when we first started. But, as time went on, our viewpoints shifted dramatically. You'll see why if you keep reading. To summarise, we now feel that the highest quality can only be reached by concentrating on one platform at a time.</p>
